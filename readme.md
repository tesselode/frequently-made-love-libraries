A list of LÃ–VE libraries that do common tasks, but are not frequently talked about. Unlike [awesome-love2d](https://github.com/love2d-community/awesome-love2d), this is not a curated list. Rather, it is a list of every known library in a certain category. This exists to help track previous attempts to solve a problem so that we aren't reinventing the wheel every day.
